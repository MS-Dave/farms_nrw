# farms_rnw
The objective of farms_nrw is to reproduce a farm population on a small administrative resolution. The application example is made for the federal state of North Rhine Westphalia in Germany, but can be adapted to any country where the required data is available. 

# Methodology
The written algorithm is based on a highest posterior density (HPD) estimator which subsequently moves fractional estimations to integers. The code is written for the programming language [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/).
